## Where It All Began

Lemonade Insurance Company (owned by the parent company, Lemonade, Inc.) was founded in 2015 by Israeli entrepreneurs Daniel Schreiber (Chief Executive) and Shai Wininger (Chief Operating Officer).

The idea for the company was birthed after the founders looked back and reflected on insurance and its domain throughout history. The concept of insurance or risk-mitigation dates back to early human civilizations where they did this instinctively, earning a claim on communal provisions in trying times by sharing their bounty in times of ease. From there, successive revolutions in industry have transformed insurance and risk management substantially. The Agricultural Revolution set the stage for this simple adaptive instinct to become a facet of trade. The inventions and innovation that prompted the Commercial Revolution brought about the first insurance companies. These flourished until the Scientific Revolution and the emergence of probability theory which led to the destruction of all those who came before it, and the beginning of the insurance empires we have today. Taking this knowledge, the founders looked at the state of things today. In their founder's letter, Chief Executive Daniel Schreiber and Chief Operating Officer Shai Wininger said, "The World Economic Forum labeled the transformations we are experiencing today the Fourth Industrial Revolution". Understanding the transformative effect of previous revolutions on insurance, they realized that every facet of the value chain is vulnerable this time. "Distribution models, business models, statistical tools, systems of management, cost structures, corporate structures, corporate culture, technology stacks, user experience, marketing channels, data sources, data uses, value propositions, human capital — all these and more are being upended." This revolation led to the eventual founding of Lemonade Insurance Company.  

The company had it's initial public offering (IPO) in July 2020 and became one of 2020's best IPO debutes closing up 139% on its first day of trading, and earning a valuation of roughly $3.81 billion. Prior to its' IPO, Lemonade had raised $480 million through several rounds of funding, with a $300 million round in April 2019 led by SoftBank Group Corp.

## Business Activities

Lemonade seeks to disrupt and reshape an antiquated industry through leveraging technology in order to change the industry's reputation from negative to positive.

Generating in excess of $5 trillion in annual revenue, Insurance is one of the largest markets in the world. Lemonade focuses primarily on younger, new insurance customers such as millenials because they are typically less attractive to larger insurers than their middle-aged counterparts. The Chief Financial Officer Tim Bixby explained the thinking behind this strategy is that “as those customers age, that drives up the value of their belongings, their need for insurance and the value to us.” 

"Powered by artificial intelligence and behavioral economics, Lemonade set out to replace brokers and bureaucracy with bots and machine learning, aiming for zero paperwork and instant everything," the company boasts on its website. To this end, Lemonade's business model varies starkly compared to other more traditional insurance carriers. Firstly, the company has no physical branch offices, minimal staff, and offers standardized rates for all customers. This simplified approach decreases overhead considerably giving Lemonade a pricing edge over the large majority of competitors. However, the fee structure of the company and how they treat premiums is arguably the most unique feature of its business model. Lemonade is a certified B-Corp — a for-profit Benefit Corporation — so unlike traditional insurers, Lemonade takes a maximum fixed fee to operate its business, which would typically go to the insurance brokers, and holds the remainder for claims. Each year, instead of pocketing any excess unused premiums, they are distributed to various chairities and nonprofits chosen by policyholders through the companies' annual Giveback initiative. In an interview with Forbes, CEO Daniel Schreiber expressed that Giveback is an core component of their business model and went on to explain that, "it’s designed to solve the deep distrust that plagues the insurance sector, and to align interests between us and our customers...There’s an inherent conflict of interest in traditional insurance: every dollar insurance companies pay out in claims is a dollar less to their bottom line. This creates a misalignment between insurers and their customers, bringing out the worst behavior in people. By introducing a third party—a charity—into our model, we are hopefully building a system that brings out the best in people. Us and our customers. We never want to be in conflict with our customers, and never want to make money by denying their claims.” This unique approach allows the company to expidite the claims process dramatically since there is no incentive to deny claims or draw out the process. By the same token, Lemonade's implimentation of technology across all aspects of the business has also allowed them to create a insurance experience that is fast and hassle-free. Customers can get a quote from their mobile device in as little as 90 seconds and claims get paid in as little as three minutes.  

## Harnessing the Power of Technology

Lemonade leverages several technologies to improve the value-chain of its business. The use of AI and machine learning are at the forefront though. The company has built three different AI bots to assist with business operations. The first is AI Maya, an engaging chatbot that handles everything from collecting information on customers, to providing quotes and handling the payment process. The next is AI Jim, which the bot responsible for handling claims. However, not all claims are handled solely by AI Jim. He handles approximately a third of claims, the remainder are passed along to a human. Even when this occurs, AI Jim has usually done a good amount of work on the issue leading to a much easier time for the individual taking over. CX.AI is the third chatbot used by the company, and is tasked with answering customer questions. These AI bots allow Lemonade to gather much more customer data on their customers than other traditional insurance companies. During the initial process of chatting with a customer, AI Maya is able to gather 1,700 data points. In comparison, traditional insurers typically gather somewhere between 20-50 data points for each policy. This provides the company with an incredible advantage, and allows them to use AI algorithims to more accurately assess and manage risk. Lemonade has also developed something they call the Forensic Graph, which employs AI and behavioral economics to anticipate, detect, and prevent fraud.

## Trends in InsurTech

* ***Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning***
        
    Many of the trends in insurtech are rooted in AI and machine learning. Data is a crucial to insurers, and AI and machine learning allows them to harvest greater volumes of data than ever before. Higher quality data pools provide more useful insights into consumer behavior which helps insurers to better assess and mitigate risk as well as improve their predictive accuracy. This aids in reducing costs and increasing operational efficiency. Additionally, AI and machine learning can drastically simplify and enhance the overall customer service and experience by providing a greater understanding into what consumers want, need, and their preferred method of engagement.
* ***Automation***

    The effort to harness automation can be seen in almost every industry across the globe, so it is no surprise that insurers are moving in the same direction. The increasing demand for speed, efficiency, and user experience by consumers is helping to drive this transition. Today's consumer increasingly desires straightforward, frustration-free, and easily accessible insurance. Automation integration adds to many aspects of the value chain for insurers by allowing them to boost efficiency and productivity while also providing better service to customers. Moreover, automation reduces the potential for human error, and thus, lessens the risk of violating industry regulations or financial loss.

* ***Internet of Things (IoT)***

    According to IoT Analytics, a provider of market insights and strategic business intelligence, there is approximately 21.7 billion connected devices globally. This is a colossal source of valuable data for insurers to use to further reduce risk, personalize customer interactions, and improve the overall user experience. Likewise, the use of sensors in homes and vehicles as well as other smart technology has allowed insurers acquire even more data on the behavior of their customers. As a result, insurers have been able to provide reduced insurance costs to consumers.

* ***On-Demand Personalized Protection***

    With the vast amount of sophisticated data insurers have at their disposal, a transition towards offering more personalized services to consumers is beginning to emerge. Today, consumers have the ability to purchase insurance more frequently in smaller quantities as the need arises. The days of being forced to buy insurance in bulk because there was no alternative have passed. This move towards flexibility and personalization have led to a more convenient and rewarding experience for the customer.
* ***Blockchain***

    Blockchain is another fast growing trend in this domain. The areas of wholesale, commercial, and reinsurance are highly complex, and this is where blockchain technology has played a significant role. By allowing companies to streamline highly manual processes like claims management and underwriting, they are able to serve customers faster and more efficiently than before.
* ***Digital Engagement***

    Today's consumer is increasingly digital, with the large majority of individuals having immediate access to a smart device nearly every waking minute of the day. As a result, many insurers are moving towards the use of mobile applications, websites, and social media to connect digitally with their customers. This allows them to increase brand awareness, trust, and customer retention.

## Business Impact and Performance
Lemonade's unique approach to insurance has materialized itself in the company's increasing success in the form customer reviews, employ engagement, advocacy, and so on. In addition, Lemonade has been featured in the following Forbes lists: "America's Best Insurance Firms", "Best Startup Employers", and "Fintech 50". However, to get a glimpse at the business performance of the company we need to take a look at the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

In insurance and insurtech, some of the core metrics used to measure performance include:
* In Force Premium 
* Customers
* Gross Earned Premium
* Total Revenue
* Net Losses
* Loss Ratio

As of Q3 2020, Lemonade had $188.9 million in force premium, up 99% YOY. The company had 941,313 customers, up 67% YOY. Gross earned premium was $42.9 million, up 104% YOY. Total revenue was $73.9 million, up 68% YOY. Net losses of $88.4 million, up 17% YOY. The loss ratio was 72%, down 7.7% YOY. All-in-all, these numbers show the company is continuing to find success and grow. What is more, the loss ratio is the primary measure used to determine how effective the company is utilizing AI to quantify risk, and from 2017 to 2019 Lemonade was able to improve its loss ratio from 161% to 79%.


## Moving Forward

Lemonade has done well to break into a domain riddled with legacy incumbents. However, it currently only offers property and casualty insurance (renters, homeowners, and pet insurance). If Lemonade wants to truly compete in this industry, against the traditional insurance giants, it must look to expand its product offerings to other lines of insurance. So far, it appears that customers have been very happy to work with Lemonade and its business model. If the company is able to transition this success into other types of coverage, it could be extremely lucrative. Of course, the insurance industry is highly regulated, so there are obvious hurdles that will need to be overcome. Nevertheless, providing an array of insurance lines would effectively enable the company to become a one-stop-shop for all a customer's insurance needs. Furthermore, this would likely allow it to capture more of the market, in particular, those that choose to do business with the larger insurers because they can get everything in one place rather than having to go through multiple carriers. Similarly, this would increase the lifetime value of its current customers since there is a higher probability of them transitioning their other insurance needs to the company if they are already happy with the service they are getting. Offering other forms of insurance wouldn't need any additional technologies either. Simply modifying its AI algorithms would allow Lemonade to apply its analytic techniques in other areas. 

Lemonade appears to be thinking similarly because in the Q3 2020 shareholder letter, the company outlined its plans to launch a life insurance product for the first time during the last quarter of the year. This is an exciting step forward, and it will be interesting to watch how this nascent company does in the coming years.
